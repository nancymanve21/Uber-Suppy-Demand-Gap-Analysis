# Uber-Suppy-Demand-Gap-Analysis
Exploratory Data Analysis of Uber ride request data to identify demand–supply gaps. The project uses Python, Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib to clean data, extract time-based features, analyze request status by hour and day, and visualize patterns to understand peak demand, shortages, and operational insights.
📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of Uber ride request data to identify demand–supply gaps. The analysis helps understand when and where ride cancellations and unavailability occur, enabling better operational decision-making.

🎯 Objectives
Analyze Uber ride requests based on time and pickup point,
Identify peak demand hours,
Study cancellation and no-car-available patterns,
Visualize demand, supply, and gap trends

🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used
Python,
Pandas,
NumPy,
Matplotlib,
Jupyter Notebook

📂 Dataset Description
The dataset contains Uber ride request details including:
Request timestamp,
Pickup point (City / Airport),
Ride status (Completed, Cancelled, No Cars Available)

🔍 Key Analysis Performed
Data cleaning and preprocessing,
Feature extraction (Request Hour, Day, Date),
Hourly and daily demand analysis,
Demand vs supply comparison,
Gap analysis to identify shortages,
Visualization using line plots and bar charts

📊 Insights
Peak demand occurs during morning and evening of the day,
Airport pickup shows higher cancellation and gap rates,
Significant mismatch between demand and supply during rush hours
